## Data 
While students are encouraged to discover archives that match their interests, we provide access to four pre-curated data sets that can be downloaded onto your computer. These data sets have undergone transformed from their original sources (see data citations). 

__The U.S. Congress Congressional Records__: The Congressional Record is the official record of the proceedings and debates of the United States Congress. It is published online daily when Congress is in session.
